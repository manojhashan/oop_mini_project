🚀 <b>Excited to share my latest project!</b> 🚀

I've developed a simple notepad application using object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts in C++. This project has been a fantastic journey, allowing me to deepen my understanding of C++ and OOP principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

<b>Key Features:</b>
<ul>
  <li>📝 <b>User-Friendly Interface</b>: Clean and intuitive design for a seamless note-taking experience.</li>
  <li>🔍 <b>Search Functionality</b>: Quickly find your notes with an efficient search feature.</li>
  <li>💾 <b>Save & Load</b>: Easily save your notes and load them when needed.</li>
  <li>🛠️ <b>OOP Design</b>: Utilizes classes and objects to create a modular and maintainable codebase.</li>
</ul>

<p>This project has enhanced my coding skills and reinforced the importance of structured programming and design patterns in software development.</p>
